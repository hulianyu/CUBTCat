# CUBTCat

This repository is an organized adaptation of the "Interpretable Clustering using Unsupervised Binary Trees ([CUBT](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-013-0129-3)) " R package ([V3.3](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/badih.ghattas/cubt.php#news)), focusing solely on its application to categorical data, in alignment with the paper "Clustering nominal data using unsupervised binary decision trees ([CUBTCat](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2017.01.031))".

## Features
- Extracted and organized functions specific to categorical data from the original CUBT package into a single .R file, `CUBT_Cat.R`, for easier use.

- Utilize Entropy for the Heterogeneity criterion and Hamming distance for the Pruning stage.

- Example Figure (Tic-Tac-Toe data set)
